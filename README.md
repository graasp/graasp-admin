# graasp-admin

## Important: The code is not throughly tested and may contain bugs.

## Pending tasks:

### 1. Login

### 2. Query Client:

The old query client in this repo is outdated. We should either use existing hooks/mutations, add commonly used hooks/mutations to query-client repo, or extend the query client with hooks/mutations that are solely used in graasp-admin.

### 3. Add or substitute hooks/mutations

There are several places marked 'TODO' in CategorieswView.js, ValidationView.js, SingleValidation.js, which need to add newly created hooks/mutations. Besides, in other views, most existing hooks need to be substituted with new ones.

### 4. Reports View:

Similar to Item View, display all item-flag entries.
